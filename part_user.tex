\chapter{Navigating the Home Page} \label{chap:user-homepage}

After logging in, you will be directed to the \textsl{Home} page, which displays all the targets you are authorized to access, depending on your user permission: \textsl{Core Team} members have full access to all entries, while \textsl{Collaborators} can only view the targets and blocks assigned to their group, with any restricted or denied blocks and associated data files remaining hidden.

Each target is displayed with several fields that provide key information at a glance:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Image}: target's associated image, if available.
	\item \textbf{Name}: unique identifier of the target.
	\item \textbf{Type}: category of the astronomical object.
	\item \textbf{Right Ascension}: celestial coordinate along the equatorial plane [hh:mm:ss].
	\item \textbf{Declination}: celestial coordinate perpendicular to the equatorial plane [dd:mm:ss].
	\item \textbf{Apparent Magnitude}: brightness of the target as observed from Earth.
	\item \textbf{Redshift (z)}: measured redshift of the object.
	\item \textbf{Angular Size}: apparent size of the target in the sky.
	\item \textbf{Visibility Semester}: observing semester when the target was observed.
	\item \textbf{Observing Run}: name of the observing run(s) the target belongs to.
	\item \textbf{Instrument}: instrument used to acquire data for the target.

\chapter{Downloading Files} \label{chap:user-download-files}
   	
  	On the \textsl{Home} page, locate the target of interest. In the \texttt{Data Files} column, you will see the available files along with a download icon. Clicking this icon opens the file download view.

\addimage

In this view, a table lists all files associated with the selected target. You can select one, multiple, or all files at once. If only a single file is selected, it will be downloaded directly. If multiple files are selected, a .zip archive containing all selected files is generated. The download process is handled directly by your web browser.

\chapter{Logging Out} \label{chap:user-logout}

To securely exit the platform, click the \texttt{LOG OUT} option located in the header at the top-right corner of the page. This will end your session and return you to the welcome page. Your session will also automatically expire after 15 minutes of inactivity, requiring you to log in again.
